# ml-image-transfer-explorations

For this assignment, the main goal was to get a local version of TensorFlow-GPU running on my mac. Once I had that setup, I began to play with the various machine learning worksheets, with a specific focus on the style transger algorithm.

Ussualy, I've seen examples of mixing contemporary imagery with style imagery from the 19th/20th century painting. I wanted to see if I could mix styles outside of paiting, like architecture, advertisements and music videos.

Playing with these images, I began to gain a better understanding of how the algorithm works, when it thrives, and when it fails to return an interesting result. Included are many of the source images and results I had, but I will share my favorite ones here:

In this example I mixed a photo from an iphone production factory and a sleek iphone advertisment. 

Of all my attempts, this one most succesffuly merged an original image with a new style:  here the iphone advertisment aesthetic is immedietly evident, but if you look closer you can see the outline of the word **FOXCON** and you can begin to tease out the shape of assembly line workers.

It's an interesting mechanism to mix the way these products are presented in the west and the actual conditions of their production.
